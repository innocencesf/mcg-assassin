You walk over to the bonfire, appreciating the warm glow of the fire on this frigid morning. You grab a bowl of grub and sit down in front of the fire and devour it; you hadn't realized you were so hungry. As you're eating, you overhear a conversation between two mercenaries sitting near you.

"Did you hear about last night? Apparently Rob went missing on his night shift. They haven't found him yet," says the first man.
"Really? I always told him to pay more attention. Just because it's night doesnt mean there isn't anything out there," replied the other.

You decide that you should investigate this piece of information later.
